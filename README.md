# Super-Bit-Shader
Super Bit Shader is a GLSL Retroarch Pixel Index shader that allows the user to color monochromatic games using a variety of palettes.

**Supported Consoles**
Game Boy, Virtual Boy, Neo Geo Pocket, Wonderswan

**How to Setup**
1. First you need to install [Retroarch](https://www.retroarch.com/) and set its Video settings to GL before using this shader.

2. Download the this repo to get all the shaders on your device.

3. Next decide which console you are going to use this shader with, these shaders are separated by folders to make that easier.
**NOTE**: You can use unsupported systems but colors may be misrepresented.

4. If your new to shaders and shader passes, I recommend watching [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyZ6IrmsNgY). 
**NOTE**: These shaders are not a preset but are each a shader pass.

6. This shader is not designed to be loaded as a preset but as the first shader pass, load the shader pass and apply the changes.
